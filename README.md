Compilation of codes used in the "Digital Image Processing" class

Hello, first of all I want to clarify that English is not my first language, so if you find spelling errors I would be grateful if you would notify me.
As it says in the description of the repository, in this place I will be saving everything related to code about a class called "Digital Image Processing".

Well that's it
